## Congestive Heart Failure Preventative Quality Metrics

## Getting Started 

### Assumptions

Here we are assuming the 5 datasets from [CMS Synthetic Public Use Files](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF) are available in a database. 

CMS SynPuf is used because it will mimic EDI claim transactions in a healthcare setting. The datatypes and meaning of fields used should be very similar to existing claims datasets. 

#### Input Data

Datbase: 

Tables: 

### Running the notebook

Calc Denominator inclusion/exclusion
Calc Numerator (subset of denom) inclusion/exclusion
Aggregate within provider group (ACO, Hospital, etc)

#### For claims pre 10-01-2015 service or CMS SynPuf


#### For claims post 10-01-2015


### Output 

Sample records... prvdr + numerator + denominator + score
