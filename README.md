Patient Risk and Provider Quality are closely intertwined and in as part of [patient risk scoring solution accelerator](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/hls-patient-risk) (patients who have beeen diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure) we determine which organizations are best suited to treat at risk patients for CHF. 

The measure developed is a value between 0 (good) and 1 (bad) for providers who treat patients with CHF. This measure is part of the Preventative Quality Indicators (PQIs) developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
