# Spark UDF of CMS DRG Grouper v39

MS-DRGs are a summarization of inpatient stay information into a simple 3 digit DRG Code. This is done through a defined set of rules set forth by CMS, and recently CMS has provided source Java code that implements these sets of rules. In addition to the DRG Code, a medical/surgical indicator as well as a major diagnostic category (MDC) code is produced by the grouper software. More information can be found on CMS's [website](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/acuteinpatientpps/ms-drg-classifications-and-software)
